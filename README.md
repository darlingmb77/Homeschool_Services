# Homeschool_Services
This is for a homeschool services site. It will include shopping experience for the curious parent.



Overall-

This would implement the display of merchandise, a shopping cart, a payment module, and an inventory control mechanism.

Introduction-

The site I would like to build would be one for my mother. An online store to schedule and purchase her curriculum/e-books and services for homeschooling parents and children. One to connect and build her reputation online and offer her services across the internet to reach more individuals. Since this site primarily focuses on advertising individual services, it emphasizes what the business offers rather than displaying an automatic online store as the home screen.

Home Page-

This page will grab the attention of the user and provide them with some details about this business. Giving brief descriptions of who we are, providing quick links to places within the website that will grab their attention, offering them quick insight on the pros of homeschooling, and providing steps on the best place to look for things on the site.

Merchandise pages-

With two different pages, merchandise is separated by two pages, one page being for curriculum/e-books which will be posted, offering a

 The other page will provide descriptions of the services offered by this business, such as curriculum review, evaluation services, and graduation transcripts, which will be displayed with the same details as the e-books, the exception being that you have to select a date and time before you can enter it into the shopping cart.

Shopping Cart Page-

With a 2-column layout, this page will display the selected items on the left and the pricing on the right, offering the user the ability to view totals and review purchases before checkout. Adding the common functionalities of modifying items, deleting, and, in this case, adjusting the service date and time.

Payment Module-

This payment module will offer the user the ability to pay for e-books immediately, and with the services it will provide an option to delay the payment for three weeks before the appointment/ service, sending them reminders that their fee is due.

Conclusion-

Collectively, all these pages should offer the user A platform through which they can navigate to purchase a curriculum and book different services based on their specifications.
